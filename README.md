# Solana Payment App - Gill Library Exploration

This is a hack project built to explore and understand the [Gill library](https://www.gillsdk.com).
This app uses Solana wallet adapter ecosystem for wallet connections 
and leverages the Gill library for transaction construction.

## Getting Started

This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm dev
```

Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL` in `.env.local` with your Solana RPC endpoint.
